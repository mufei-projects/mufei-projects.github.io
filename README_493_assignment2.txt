Mardi Gras Parade!

Extra functions:

1.Instead of replacing open settings panel button with a setting panel, replace open settings panel button with close settings panel button, and a setting panel appears below. With this implementation, people who click the open settings panel button by mistake can simply repeat the clicking and return to the game, and don't have to go through the settings panel and choose discard the change option between two options.
